# a-simple-speech-to-text-program
It's a simple speech to text program (voice recognizer) with gui (tkinter) and Python

First, you need to install speech_recognition
using : pip install SpeechRecognition

for using the microphone , you need have pyaudio installed
you can install it using : pip install PyAudio

you may face problem if you use windows for installing the pyaudio
you can solve this problem using :

pip install pipwin 

and then 

pipwin install PyAudio

/pipwin is like pip, but it installs precompiled Windows binaries provided by Christoph Gohlke. Saves you a lot of manual googling and downloading./

or if you use anconda 
you can use conda instead of pip :
conda install PyAudio
